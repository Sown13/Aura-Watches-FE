            <h2>Introducing The Piaget Altiplano Concept Tourbillon, The World's <br /> Thinnest Tourbillon (Live Pics)</h2>
            <div class="content" style={{backgroundColor: "black"}}>
                <div style={{ marginRight: "20px" , backgroundColor:"black"}}>
                    <p>In many ways, Piaget is ultra-thin watchmaking. While Bulgari has reclaimed the title of the world's
                        thinnest watch with the new Octo Finissimo Ultra (1.7mm thin), Piaget's after a different prize. I'm not
                        sure my eyes are actually capable of perceiving the 0.3 difference between these two watches, nor can my
                        mind comprehend how a tourbillon can spin freely in those cramped quarters. Or how Piaget managed to
                        power that whirring mechanism? Sure, the manufacturer says it had to find a more powerful spring with a
                        thicker blade, and it fit most of the gear train on ball bearings to minimize friction.

                        Yes, I want Piaget to focus more on finding ways to revisit its heritage. But ultra-thin watchmaking is
                        in its blood, too. With all of these watches chasing ultra-thin superlatives, we're well beyond the
                        realm of practicality. Brands are shaving tenths of a millimeter off of millimeters just because they
                        can.

                        The Piaget Altiplano Ultimate Concept Tourbillon is a watch that has to be seen to be believed, but even
                        after that, I'm not sure I comprehend it.

                        The Piaget Altiplano Concept Tourbillon features a blue cobalt case measuring 41.5x2mm. The Piaget
                        caliber 970P-UC is a manual-wind movement with peripheral one-minute tourbillon and 40-hour power
                        reserve. Price upon request. For more, visit Piaget.com.

                    <p>While the caliber has been reworked, the principle of the AUC stays the same: the case and movement are
                        one. In other words, the movement's components are directly integrated into the caseback. The tourbillon
                        rotates at 10 o'clock and the uncovered mainspring barrel sits prominently at 6 o'clock. The tourbillon
                        uses ball bearings instead of pivots to rotate; this construction also allows Piaget to execute a
                        sapphire opening in the caseback that makes the tourbillon visible.

                        Price is on request, but to give you an idea, the original record-breaking Altiplano Ultimate Concept
                        (without tourbillon) had a price north of $400,000. So you'll have a thinner watch and wallet.

                    <p>The Submersible QuarantaQuattro Luna Rossa Ti-Ceramitech is available with two dials: PAM01466 has a blue
                        sunburst dial, while PAM01543 has a grained white dial. Both come with a textile rubber strap.</p>
                    <p>Pricing was not yet known at the time of publication.</p>
                    <p>The new Piaget AUC features a cobalt blue case that's blue PVD-treated and measures 41.5x2mm. Most
                        importantly, it's powered by the Piaget caliber 970P-UC, a manual caliber with a one-minute peripheral
                        tourbillon and 40-hour power reserve. According to Piaget, it had to redesign 90 percent of the movement
                        to accommodate a tourbillon, which requires 25 percent more power from the mainspring. It takes the
                        title of world's thinnest tourbillon from the Bulgari Octo Finissimo Tourbillon, which comes in at a
                        positively chunky 3.95mm. </p>
